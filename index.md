## Introducing **Tallis Dawson**
Hey Gamers,
If you want to skip to crochet: [click here](https://github.com/TallisDawson/Cse110_Lab1/new/main#crochet)  
I like programming!  
Here are my favorite languages, ordered:
1. C/C++
2. Java
3. ARM

Here's some code I wrote lol:
``` 
void DoublyList::destroyList()
{ 	
    while (first != nullptr)
    {
        Node  *temp = first;
        first = first->getNext();
        delete temp;
		temp = nullptr;
    }

    last = nullptr;
	count = 0;
}
```

if you'd like to look at the repo readme, here it is:

## *Crochet*
I also crochet and recently crocheted a few things:
- Baby blanket
- Animal crossing dice bag
- Butterfly shirt
- fun hat!

More abt the fun hat, it has a small pompom that you can only see from the back so I always say:
> business in the front  
*turns around*  
> party in the back
